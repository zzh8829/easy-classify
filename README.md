# Easy and Simple Image Classifier

## Motivation

While creating AI environment for video games, I found there was no easy way to detect game state from screen in real-time. So combing the power of [DeepCapture](https://github.com/zzh8829/deep-capture) and Deep Convolutional Neural Network, I created this tool to classify images.
